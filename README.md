## How to run for development

1. Clone this repository
2. Install all dependencies

```bash
npm i
```

3. Populate `.env` file based on `.env.example`. `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL` should point to your API server (cripto-back)

4. Run the back-end in a development environment:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building and starting for production

```bash
npm run build
npm run dev
```
